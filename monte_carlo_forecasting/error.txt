/home/nuno/Software/python/gjopen-jonathan/monte_carlo_forecasting/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pandas/io/html.py:661: MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning: The input passed in on this line looks more like a filename than HTML or XML.

If you meant to use Beautiful Soup to parse the contents of a file on disk, then something has gone wrong. You should open the file first, using code like this:

    filehandle = open(your filename)

You can then feed the open filehandle into Beautiful Soup instead of using the filename.

However, if you want to parse some data that happens to look like a filename, then nothing has gone wrong: you are using Beautiful Soup correctly, and this warning is spurious and can be filtered. To make this warning go away, run this code before calling the BeautifulSoup constructor:

    from bs4 import MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning
    import warnings

    warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning)

  soup = BeautifulSoup(udoc, features="html5lib", from_encoding=from_encoding)
